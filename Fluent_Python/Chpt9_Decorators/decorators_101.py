"""
A decorator is a callable that takes another function as an argument (the decorated
function).
A decorator may perform some processing with the decorated function, and returns
it or replaces it with another function or callable object.

In other words, assuming an existing decorator named decorate, this code:
@decorate
def target():
    print('running target()')

has the same effect as writing this:
def target():
    print('running target()')

target = decorate(target)

The end result is the same: at the end of either of these snippets, the target name is
bound to whatever function is returned by decorate(target)â€”which may be the
function initially named target, or may be a different function.
